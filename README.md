### ðŸ‘‹â€Š Welcome ! 

I'm a third-year student at EPITA (Engineering School in IT).
I'm passionate about computer science.

## ðŸ“š Projects
- **42sh** : Shell POSIX from scratch in C. 
- **ants_game** : implementation of a simulation of ants in a grid by using multithreading in C.

Some other projects are in private because I need to wait until I graduate from EPITA.
